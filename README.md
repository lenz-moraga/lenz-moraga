## Hello There, I'm [Lener Moraga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lener-moraga/) ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm a Frontend Developer, I have extensive experience in creating and maintaining user-friendly web interfaces using technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I specialize in ReactJs and TypeScript to build dynamic and responsive web applications that prioritize user experience. My responsibilities include collaborating with cross-functional teams, implementing UI/UX design specifications, and optimizing web performance for a seamless user journey.

I am proficient in using design tools like Figma, Photoshop, and Illustrator to create simple graphics and layouts.

From the beginning of the year, I've been working with BE, using NodeJS with NestJS, maintaining existing APIs, and creating new endpoints. I'm currently learning BE technologies as NodeJs with NestJS and C# in order to level up my proffesional Career and become a âœ¨Fullstack developerâœ¨.
